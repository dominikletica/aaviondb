# üß† Welcome to AavionDB

**AavionDB** is a modular, lightweight PHP framework for flexible data management, built around JSON serialization and designed to work in almost any PHP environment.  
It offers both a **native PHP API** and a **REST interface** for full integration into your existing projects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **User-friendly API calls** ‚Äì Access data via PHP class or REST interface.
- **Structured flat-file storage** ‚Äì Stores project data in modular, human-readable JSON files.  
  *(Future versions may add optional SQL backends.)*
- **Flexible fieldsets** for universal adaptability.
- **Lightweight and headless** ‚Äì No persistent server process required.
- **Shared-host ready** ‚Äì Only PHP ‚â• 8.1 required, no Node.js or database servers needed.
- **Extensible architecture** ‚Äì Custom modules and plugins can add new functionality.
- **UI integration hooks** ‚Äì AavionDB exposes interfaces for the separate **AavionStudio** front-end (planned).
- **Export functionality** ‚Äì Create JSON-based slices for integration with tools like ChatGPT or other LLMs.  
  These parser-friendly files act as contextual datasets for AI tools that can‚Äôt natively store large amounts of structured data.

## üß© Planned Command Overview

### Core Commands
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `list projects` | Returns a list of all valid projects. |
| `list entities {project}` | Lists all valid entities within the specified project. |
| `list versions {project} {entity}` | Lists all versions of an entity. |
| `list commits {project} [entity]` | Returns all commits for a project (or a specific entity). |
| `show {entity}` | Displays the currently active version of an entity as structured JSON. |
| `show {entity(@version or #hash)}` | Displays a specific version or commit of the entity. |
| `save {project} {entity} {full JSON}` | Saves an entity. If an ID exists, creates a new version and commit; otherwise creates a new entity. Returns version and deterministic commit hash. |
| `create {project}` | Creates a new project. |
| `remove {project} [entity]` | Marks the active version as invalid. |
| `restore {project} [entity(@version or #hash)]` | Reactivates a previous version or commit. |
| `delete {project} [entity]` | Permanently deletes all versions of a specified project or entity (use with caution). |

### Export Commands
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `export {project} [entities[@version or #hash]]` | Exports a project or subset as JSON for LLM use, including metadata for crawlers and parsers. |

---

### Simple Key-Value Storage
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `set {key} {value}` / `get {key}` | Store and retrieve basic configuration values. |
| `get` | Lists all existing keys. *(These values are not versioned.)* |

---

### Brain Management
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `brains` | Lists all available databases (‚Äúbrains‚Äù). |
| `init {brain}` | Initializes or activates a brain (only one can be active at a time). |
| `backup {brain}` | Creates a snapshot of the active brain with timestamp. |
| `delete {brain}` | Permanently removes a brain. *(Use with extreme caution!)* |

---

### API Commands
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `api serve` | Starts the REST API service (via `api.php`). |
| `api stop` | Stops the API service. |
| `api reset` | Regenerates the API key and invalidates the old one. |

---

### Authentication Commands
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `auth grant` | Generates a new alphanumeric API key (16 characters). |
| `auth revoke {key}` | Invalidates the given API key. |

---

### Miscellaneous
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `help` | Lists all available commands and usage syntax. |
| `status` / `info` | Displays framework version, memory usage, author info, GitHub link, and active brain. |

Commands can be invoked universally across interfaces:

REST:
```bash
GET api.php?command
{
"list projects"
}
```

PHP:
```php
AavionDB::command('list projects')
```

CLI:
```bash
php api.php list projects
```

Note: The preferred method is to use a parametric approach passing parameters and values: `brain`, `project`, `entity`, `ref`, `payload`, ...

---

## üß≠ Usage
Simply place the framework in your project directory and run the setup command to initialize it.

```bash
php api.php setup
```
or inside PHP:
```php
include aaviondb/api.php;
AavionDB::setup(); //lazily bootstraps; repeated calls are ignored within the same request
```

More commands will be documented as development progresses.

### Configuration

- Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php` and adjust the values before exposing AavionDB publicly.
  - `admin_secret` ‚Äî Master secret (must start with `_` and be ‚â• 8 characters). When set, it bypasses API keys and `api serve`; keep it safe.
  - `default_brain` ‚Äî Slug of the initial user brain (defaults to `default`).
  - `backups_path`, `exports_path`, `log_path` ‚Äî Override storage locations (relative paths resolve from the repo root).
  - `response_exports` / `save_exports` ‚Äî Control whether export commands return JSON in the response and/or persist files to disk.
  - `api_key_length` ‚Äî Length of generated API keys (default 16).
- If `config.php` is missing, the built-in defaults are used and the admin secret remains disabled (empty string).

### REST API

- Endpoint: `api.php?action=<command>` (e.g. `api.php?action=list&scope=projects`).
- JSON payloads are accepted in the request body (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).
- Responses always follow the unified schema `{status, action, message, data, meta}`.
- All errors are returned with HTTP 400/500; PHP exceptions are logged, not exposed.
- REST remains disabled until the CLI command `api serve` toggles `api.enabled = true` and a non-bootstrap token exists.  Provide the token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (fallback: `X-API-Key` header or `token`/`api_key` parameter).  The bootstrap key `admin` never grants REST access.

### CLI

- Execute commands from the shell:

```bash
php cli.php "list projects"
```

- Exit code `0` indicates success; `1` signals an error.
- Output is JSON-formatted for easy piping to other tools.

## üß∞ Development Notes
- Node.js and Composer are used **only for development**; production deployments require PHP 8.1+ only.
- Install dependencies locally via `composer install` and `npm install` after cloning (both directories are ignored in git).
- When packaging releases, ship only production-ready dependencies (omit dev packages such as PHPUnit or frontend build tooling).
- Versioning is handled internally via deterministic commit hashes for integrity verification.
- JSON exports are structured for high parser compatibility, making aavionDB ideal for AI and automation workflows.
- Vendors (`/vendor`) and Node modules (`/node_modules`) are excluded from version control.  
  Run `composer install` and `npm install` to fetch dependencies locally.  
  When preparing releases, bundle only production dependencies.
