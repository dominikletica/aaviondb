# Welcome to aavionDB
aavionDB offers a simple and ready-to-use PHP-framework for flexible data storage with JSON serialization to use inside your PHP projects.

## Key features
- User-friendly API calls (via PHP class or REST)
- Stores any project data in structured flat files (SQL database fetures may be added in the future)
- Flexible fieldsets for universal usability
- Lightweight and nearly headless with no need for persistent server processes (unlike most Node.js-driven JSON-APIs)
- Ideal for most environments such as shared hosting, only PHP (8.1+) needed
- Adding functionality with custom modules will be added in the future
- A simple web-interface for direct interaction
- Exporter to generate slices as JSON-files to be used in external tools such as LLMs/Chatbots  
  Usage-example: These parser-friendly structured files can be used as a database-layer for web based chat tools like ChatGPT, that usually don't offer the capability to hold lage ammounts of context to work with.

## Usage
Just place inside your project and use the setup-command to set everything up.

// To-Do: concise available commands and create usage documentation

## Support and contact
This project is under active development and is not yet ready to be used. Use at your own risk!  
No support or issue tracking until a stable state is reached (v1.0)!
