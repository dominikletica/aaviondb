# 🧠 Welcome to AavionDB

**AavionDB** is a modular, lightweight PHP framework for flexible data management, built around JSON serialization and designed to work in almost any PHP environment.  
It offers both a **native PHP API** and a **REST interface** for full integration into your existing projects.

## ✨ Key Features

- **User-friendly API calls** – Access data via PHP class or REST interface.
- **Structured flat-file storage** – Stores project data in modular, human-readable JSON files.  
  *(Future versions may add optional SQL backends.)*
- **Flexible fieldsets** for universal adaptability.
- **Lightweight and headless** – No persistent server process required.
- **Shared-host ready** – Only PHP ≥ 8.1 required, no Node.js or database servers needed.
- **Extensible architecture** – Custom modules and plugins can add new functionality.
- **UI integration hooks** – AavionDB exposes interfaces for the separate **AavionStudio** front-end (planned).
- **Export functionality** – Create JSON-based slices for integration with tools like ChatGPT or other LLMs.  
  These parser-friendly files act as contextual datasets for AI tools that can’t natively store large amounts of structured data.
