# BrainAgent Module (DRAFT)

> Status: Draft – placeholder for brain lifecycle documentation.

## Responsibilities
- Manage brain discovery, activation, initialisation, and backups.
- Expose configuration helpers (system vs user brains).
- Publish integrity snapshots for diagnostics.

## Outstanding Tasks
- [ ] Define command syntax (`brains`, `brain init`, …) with examples.
- [ ] Detail interactions with `BrainRepository` helpers.
- [ ] Capture edge cases (missing brain, backup failures).
