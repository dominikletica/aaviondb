# UI & Web Console

> **Status:** Maintained â€“ awaiting AavionStudio implementation  
> **Last updated:** 2025-10-20

## Integration Notes
- Shared assets/templates (if any) live under `system/assets/` and are consumed by external front-ends.  
- External UI authenticates via REST (Bearer token); bootstrap flows remain CLI-only.  
- The upcoming UiAgent will expose hooks so Studio can trigger commands, subscribe to events, and display diagnostics.
